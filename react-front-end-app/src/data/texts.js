`A **baby's brain is** as **intricate and enigmatic** as a celestial labyrinth. From birth to age six, it develops at an astonishing pace. By three, **the strides children make** in *movement, language, understanding, and adapting to our world* **are truly astounding**.  

These **early years** either **build a** strong, supportive **foundation** or a fragile, unreliable one, **which shapes all future learning, behavior, and health**.  

It is imperative to **prepare environments that nurture holistic development** at every stage.  
> Your child's brain is *growing every moment*, shaped by **accident or** by **intention**.  
> The choice is **your**s, but a **choice** that **profoundly matters to your child**.`

`**Every moment** in a baby's life **builds the architecture of the brain**. When babies are free to explore — touching, tasting, watching, and listening — they are wiring the foundations for all future learning, behavior, and health.  

More than the toys, it's the **moments of connection** that **matter most** — when you meet their gaze, follow their curiosity, or let them lead the play. These moments create harmony between emotion and understanding, forming a strong, flexible base for lifelong growth.
>Every look, word, and gesture shapes the brain's foundation.  
>Every moment you share builds the world your child will stand on.`

**Neurons — the brain's building blocks** — form the vast network of the nervous system. The **brain contains about 100 billion neurons**, each connecting to tens of thousands of others. In the first six years of life, **over a million new neural connections form every second**, shaping how a child learns, feels, and grows.

Early childhood is a period of remarkable change when the brain's foundation is built. While development continues through adolescence and adulthood, these early years determine whether that foundation is strong and supportive — or fragile and unstable.`

`**The environments** we create **either nurture independence or confine it**. **Babies thrive when given the space, time, and trust to move, explore, and discover at their own pace**. **A prepared environment is** not one filled with objects, but **one rich in freedom, safety, and opportunity to act on curiosity**.  

Being **intentional** means choosing presence over distraction, conversation over pacification, and exploration over control. It **means stepping back just enough for your child to step forward** — *developing confidence, creativity, and self-assurance* from the very start.
>Prepare environments that invite discovery. Interact with intention.
>Because every choice you make builds the reliability of your child's mind, body, and heart.`

`**Cribs** offer safety, but they also **significantly narrow what a baby can see, reach, and explore**.  
When movement and vision are confined, the brain loses valuable opportunities to connect curiosity with action.  
**Open, safe spaces invite discovery, strengthen coordination**, and *help babies trust both their bodies and their surroundings*.  
Every chance to look, reach, and move builds the architecture for confidence, learning, and lifelong growth.  

**Each movement helps the brain grow stronger.**`

export const babyWithPacifier = 
`**Babies absorb everything** — every sound, tone, and expression around them.  
**They study** what **adults** say, how they say it, and why, using every cue **to make sense of their world.**  
Watching mouths helps them learn how to form sounds and eventually, words.  
When **a pacifier** stays in too long, it **limits movement, muffles expression, and slows language development.**  
Crying isn't a nuisance — it's communication. Responding builds trust, safety, and the foundation for language and connection.  

**Speak with intention — they're listening.**`
