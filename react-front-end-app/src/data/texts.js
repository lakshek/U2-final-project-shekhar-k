`I live in your brain. Actually, *all* your brains 🧠. I've got about **100 billion** siblings up here — yes, your head is more crowded than any wild party 🎉 you can imagine.

We're wiggly, wiry, and wildly busy. Can't help it.
Even when you sleep 😴, we're buzzing around like sugar—fueled toddlers.

Why? Because *we've got one job:* **taking care of you.** And we take that job very seriously.

You had a thought ("I should read this"), then — **boom**, you clicked the button — instant brain magic ⚡️

**Input → brain → output.**

`I know what you're thinking: *“That's like a computer.”* 💻

Nope. Computers are like us. We were here first.

We moved in before you were even born — setting up shop, making connections (we call those **neural connections** ⚡️), and basically wiring your brain like a superhighway of thought 💡.

Anytime you see, hear, hug, cry, or even overthink bedtime routines, we're **forming connections** ⚡️ just for you.

And the more you *repeat* something (yes, even reading *Goodnight Moon* for the 9,000th time), the **stronger those connections get.** 💪

**Practice doesn't just make it perfect — makes it permanent.**

But here's the kicker: if you *stop using* a skill?

> We **prune** it ✂️. Marie Kondo style.  

Doesn't spark joy (or activity)? *Out it goes.*

This whole system? It's called **learning**. 🧠  
Not just school stuff — *life stuff.*

>- Babies *learning* to roll over. ↩️  
>- Kids *learning* to share (we're working on it). 😬  
>- You *learning* to survive sleep regressions. 💤

Walking, talking, parenting — all of it came from us.  
You don't remember learning to walk, right? You practiced that before you could even say “Mama.”

And look at you now!  
You've mastered walking. You don't even think about it. That was us. You're welcome.

Just imagine if you gave up walking — like you sometimes think of giving up LaunchCode… ❓

**Stick around. You can do this.**  
We've got your back. *(And your brain.)* 🧠

So when you doubt yourself, just remember:  
You're building new neural pathways with every late—night feed, every soothing bounce, every moment of connection, and every hook and link.

And don't worry — we're helping. ⚡️

### Sometimes I wonder if we're too powerful. 😏

// About Page text
export const aboutText = 
`### Hi again, it's me, Nu Ron.  
Still in your brain. Still working overtime.

Let's talk about how we roll. **Literally.**

Every single thing your baby does — wiggles, kicks, gurgles, even that confused stare at ceiling fans — it's building brain connections.

We call them **neural connections** ⚡️ (*aka synapses*), and it's kind of our thing.

>- New experience? 💥 We form one.  
>- Repeat it? 💪 We strengthen it.  
>- Something a little different? 🎨 We remix what we've got.

We start with *simple connections* before ramping up to *complex networks.*  
It's like a *never—ending construction zone* here:  
🚧 No hard hats needed — just love and repetition.

And get this:  
In the early years, we're firing off **over a million new connections every second.**

**Yeah. Per second.**  
That's more than your coffee—fueled brain can even count. ☕

Ever wonder how your baby goes from floppy newborn to standing, babbling mini—human in two years?  
That's us.

From random arm flails to crawling across the room like a determined potato — it's all part of the plan.

And no, you can't rush us.  
No flashcards or baby coding apps are going to speed up brain development.

**Every child learns at their own pace.**  
We like it that way.

We're not cramming for finals — we're **building for life.**

You want to help?

>- Set the stage. 🎭  
>- Give them space, time, love, and lots of chances to try, fumble, and try again.

That's how learning sticks.  
That's how we grow strong.

Oh — and brain development doesn't stop after the toddler years.

We're in it for the long haul:  
Childhood, teen angst, adulting — all of it.

But the early years?  
That's when we pour the foundation: **strong and steady, or wobbly and weak.**

No pressure, right? 😅

Just remember: **every drool—soaked milestone is a win.**  
You're not just wiping spit-up — *you're helping build a brain.* ⚙️

> Hey hey, I'm under construction! 🚧  
> Every tickle, tune, and "don't eat that!" moment is laying down my brain's blueprint.

> 👶 Right now, I'm wiring up my lifelong circuits for learning, behavior, and even keeping my sniffles in check.

> So yeah... every burp and babble? Kinda a big deal.`

`### So… quick question.  
Why does my life feel like a teeny tiny jail cell? 🔒

I'm trying to figure out what this world looks like, okay?  
But these crib bars? They're totally cramping my view. 👀

How's a baby supposed to get perspective when everything's vertical slats and stuffed giraffes?

Meanwhile, you're all up there — towering giants — peeking in and going, *“Aww, so cute!”* 😍

Thanks. Really. Appreciate the admiration.  
But I'd also like to admire... well, anything else. Like, at **eye level**.

I'm still upgrading my vision software over here.  
**Depth perception is not exactly installed yet.** 💾

So yeah — I'd love a better vantage point that doesn't involve me squinting through crib rails like a tiny prisoner of cuteness. 🔍

**Signed,**  
One very visually curious baby *(with a rapidly developing brain, thank you very much).*

`### Mmm-mmm-buh-guh-ooo-uh. 🤔

...Wait, you're not kidding, right?

Seriously — **what neuron approved this pacifier plan?!** ❌

I've been listening to you for weeks.  
I've studied every “mama,” “dada,” and *“who's a good widdle baby!”* you've thrown my way.

I've watched your mouth move like it's a live TED Talk. 🎙️  
My **auditory cortex** is lighting up like a disco ball.

I'm *this close* to figuring out how to make real sounds — and what do you do?

**You plug my mouth with this weird, rubbery, flavorless, speech—stopping thing.** 😶

A **pacifier**. ❓

Like, I'm going to just chill while I'm in the middle of decoding language?  
**C'mon!**

Look, crying is my fallback.  
It's the only working output system I've got right now. 🔊

You want actual words? Cool.

Step one: **free the mouth.**

>- Let me wiggle my tongue.  
>- Let me babble like a boss.  
>- Let me turn sound into meaning.

I'm not trying to be dramatic *(okay, maybe a little)* 🎭 —  
but this is **early speech development sabotage**.

**Yours gurgly,**  
*A baby on the verge of a breakthrough (if you'd just lose the paci).* 💥
